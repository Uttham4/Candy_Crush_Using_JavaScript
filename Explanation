# Candy_Crush_Using_JavaScript

I have created the Candy Crush basic version game using javascript.
For the code i have used a yuotubers code for reference.And i have improved it by creating a new candy called rainbow fire on matching 4 candies in a box manner.
The power of rainbow fire is if 3 rainbow fires are matched as column we can increase the score by 50 points.

For the images, i have already attached it in this repository.
I have reduced the size to 70*70 dimension to match a single square grid.

For clear Steps refer the following notes or the sorce code.
Initially i thought to create a similar game called CHOCO CRUSH..but i cannot get the proper image for the name choco crush
so i created the same candy crush with a special functionality.
